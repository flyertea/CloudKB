<h3 align="center">Knowledge Base Question Answering System Based on LLM Large Language Models</h3>

<hr/>

StarCloudKB, originating from MaxKB, enhances the original system with multi-language support and role assignment features.

MaxKB = Max Knowledge Base, is an open-source knowledge base question answering system based on LLM large language models, designed to be the ultimate brain for enterprises.

- **Out-of-the-box**: Supports direct document uploads, automatic online document crawling, text auto-splitting, vectorization, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and provides an excellent intelligent Q&A interaction experience.
- **Model-neutral**: Supports integration with various large language models, including local private models (Llama 3 / Qwen 2, etc.), domestic public models (Tongyi Qianwen / Zhipu AI / Baidu Qianfan / Kimi / DeepSeek, etc.), and international public models (OpenAI / Azure OpenAI / Gemini, etc.).
- **Flexible orchestration**: Built-in powerful workflow engine supports AI work process orchestration to meet the demands of complex business scenarios.
- **Seamless embedding**: Supports rapid, zero-code embedding into third-party business systems, enabling existing systems to quickly gain intelligent Q&A capabilities and improve user satisfaction.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d --name=maxkb -p 8080:8080 -v ~/.maxkb:/var/lib/postgresql/data cr2.fit2cloud.com/1panel/maxkb

# Username: admin
# Password: MaxKB@123..
```
You can also quickly deploy MaxKB + Ollama + Llama 3 through the [1Panel App Store](https://apps.fit2cloud.com/1panel), getting a local large model-based knowledge base question answering system online within 30 minutes and embedding it into third-party business systems.

For intranet environments, it is recommended to use the [offline installation package](https://community.fit2cloud.com/#/products/maxkb/downloads) for installation and deployment.

You can also experience it online: [DataEase Assistant](https://dataease.io/docs/v2/), an intelligent Q&A system built on MaxKB, already embedded in the DataEase product and online documentation.

If you need to build a technical blog or knowledge base, it is recommended to use the [Halo open-source website building tool](https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/). You can experience the official [technical blog](https://blog.fit2cloud.com/) and [knowledge base](https://kb.fit2cloud.com) cases from FIT2CLOUD.
